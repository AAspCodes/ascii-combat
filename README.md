# ASCII Combat
A simple CLI text adventure game, created for learning purposes.

### Project objectives
* Fully functional dungeon system for exploration.
* Creating an inventory system with the ability to pickup, eat and get info about items found throughout the dungeon
* Enemies distributed over dungeon entrances, explore further by beating them in a role-based combat system.

### Usage instructions
* This game uses Python's Cmd module along with colorama, an amazing ANSI sequence text colorizer
* To try the game, download the .zip file, extract it and run "main.py" - which basically sets terminal color and title before running "main.py", keep in mind this - should I call it a game? - isn't complete and is currently under development.

### Pull Requests
* I really welcome pull requests, specially if it is your first time, checkout the current issues and any little correction, bugfix, new feature will be reviewed and added if possible.
* Feel free to send PRs (Check open issues first).
* Clean, well-documented code is pretty appreciated.

### Future Plans
* We all agree its fun to play text-based games as this genre got its very own fans, however we further agree on the beauty of graphics, so I am planning to make a pygame version of this, exactly same concept with simplistic, yet beautiful 8-bit pixel art graphics, I intend to create a roguelike exploration system + a role-based combat system which acts like an obstacle to the advance of exploration in the dungeons of ASCII Combat, mmm... shall we say 'Pixel Combat'? :)
