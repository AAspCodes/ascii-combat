# ASCII Combat
A simple CLI text adventure game, created for learning purposes.

### Project objectives
* Fully functional dungeon system for exploration.
* Creating an inventory system with the ability to pickup, eat and get info about items.
* Enemies distributed over dungeon entrances, explore further by beating them in a role-based combat system.

### Usage instructions
* This game is based on the "cmd.py" module, which comes as part of the Python Standard Library.
* To try the game, download the .zip file, extract it and run "launcher.bat" - which basically sets terminal color and title before running "main.py", keep in mind this - should I call it a game? - isn't complete and is currently under development.

### Pull Requests
* Feel free to send PRs (Check open issues first).
* Clean, well-documented code is pretty appreciated.
